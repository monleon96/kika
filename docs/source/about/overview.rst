Overview
========

KIKA is a comprehensive Python toolkit for nuclear data analysis and Monte Carlo simulation support. Originally designed for working with MCNP (Monte Carlo N-Particle) input and output files, it has evolved into a full-featured library covering nuclear data formats, sensitivity analysis, covariance matrices, and more.

The library provides modern, lightweight alternatives to traditional tools, focusing on a clear, class-based design and seamless integration with the Python scientific ecosystem (NumPy, pandas, xarray, matplotlib).

Originally created for personal use, KIKA is now available publicly to support the nuclear engineering and radiation transport community. Development continues according to the author's work requirements. Community contributions are warmly welcomed via GitHub at `https://github.com/monleon96/KIKA.git <https://github.com/monleon96/KIKA.git>`_.
